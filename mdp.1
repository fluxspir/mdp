.Nm mdp

.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an acronym for "Mot de Passe", meaning "password" in French. It wraps GnuPG
for encryption and deals with all the small details of generating, managing and
fetching your passwords.
.Pp
.Nm
is similar to a dozen other programs. What differentiate it from others is an
overall goal for simplicity, not your average button-driven simplicity but more
like a Unix-y less is more style. For example, beyond the use of GnuPG for
encryption,
.Nm
lets you use your own editor to manage your passwords, categorize them and
delete them. I wouldn't use anything but my favorite editor to manage a list,
would you?
.Pp
In order to avoid passwords to linger on your screen, the results from the
queries are displayed through a custom pager that gets cleared after a
customizable timeout (default 10 seconds).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar config
Use an alternate configuration file.
.It Fl e
Edit your password file (decrypt and re-encrypt after the fact).
.It Fl q
Start
.Nm
in query mode instead of displaying results directly. This will avoid you
from entering your GPG password multiple time. Query mode times out after
a few seconds of inactivity.
.It Fl r
Displays the result without pager, plain terminal dump.
.It Fl g Ar length
Generates 4 passwords of the given length.
.It Fl V
Print version.
.It Fl h
Print usage.
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION
This is a summary of all the available configuration variables and options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo Ic set gpg_path Ar path
.Xc
GnuPG absolute path (default: /usr/bin/gpg)
.Pp
.It Ic set gpg_key_id Ar key_id
GnuPG key id (default: none). If no key is selected, gpg will attempt to pick
the key bound to the password file. When saving the file, you will be
prompted to pick the encryption key. This can get quickly annoying, you're
highly suggested to set this value.
.Pp
.It Ic set gpg_timeout Ar seconds
Number of seconds to give GnuPG for password and pipe interaction. The
default value is 10 seconds. This will kill GnuPG if you leave it on the
password prompt or of anything blocks it while it communicates with the
parent process.
.Pp
.It Ic set editor Ar path
Path to your favorite editor. You typically don't need to set this variable
since
.Nm
will use your default editor (as defined by $EDITOR). 
.Pp
.It Ic set timeout Ar seconds
This variable define how long the pager will display your passwords. The
default value is 10 seconds.
.Nm
will use your default editor (as defined by $EDITOR). 
.Pp
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag width EDITOR
.It Ev EDITOR
The content of this variable will be used as default editor if the
configuration does not alter it.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag width "woot"
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/config
Main configuration file for
.Nm .
You should seriously consider putting at least your gpg_key_id in there.
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/passwords
Encrypted list of passwords.
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/passwords.bak
This file is a copy of your password file, before the last edit. Only one
copy is kept in case you with to revert your last change. You can override
the main password file with this one to do that.
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/lock
This file is created while you edit your password list to avoid two copies
of mdp to run at the same time for the same user.
