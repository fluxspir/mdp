mdp - minimalist password safe
==============================

INTRO
    mdp is acronym for "Mot De Passe", which means password in French.

    Wrap PGP/GnuPG for encryption and deal with the other small factors of
    storing, creating and editing passwords.

    mdp tries to stay out of your way on the editing side, it will spawn your
    editor and let you organize your passwords any way you want.

    This script started as a simple shell script but a few features were
    getting too complex to be handled in a shell script. Instead of playing
    with more external programs, keeping PIDs and juggling with signals, I
    rewrote the whole thing as a simple C program.

REQUIREMENTS
    You need GnuPG and a working key configured. Have a look at the following
    URL if you have no idea what this means:

INSTALL
    make
    sudo make install

SETUP
    The following options are available as configuration variables in your
    ~/.mdp/config file. All paths have to be absolute, all are optional and
    have semi-sane defaults.

    # Defines where to find GnuPG
    set gpg_path = "/usr/local/bin/gpg"

    # GnuPG absolute path (default: /usr/bin/gpg)
    set gpg_path "/usr/local/bin/gpg"

    # GnuPG key id (default: none, let gpg pick a key)
    set gpg_key_id "6453194A"

    # Editor used in edit mode (defaults to $EDITOR or /usr/bin/vi)
    set editor "/usr/local/bin/vim"

    # Timeout in show mode in seconds (default: 10)
    set timeout 2


TODO
    - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict
      resolution (lines stored separately?)
    - gracefully degrade when the term size if too small instead of dying.
