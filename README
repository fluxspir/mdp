mdp - minimalist password safe
==============================

INTRO
    mdp is an acronym for "Mot de Passe", which means "password" in French. It
    wraps GnuPG for encryption and deals with all the small details of
    generating, managing and fetching your passwords.

    mdp is similar to a dozen other programs. What differentiate it from others
    is an overall goal for simplicity, not your average button-driven
    simplicity but more like a Unix-y less is more style. For example, beyond
    the use of GnuPG for encryption, mdp lets you use your own editor to manage
    your passwords, categorize them and delete them. I wouldn't use anything
    but my favorite editor to manage a list, would you?

    In order to avoid passwords to linger on your screen, the results from the
    queries are displayed through a custom pager that gets cleared after a
    customizable timeout (default 10 seconds).


REQUIREMENTS
    You need GnuPG and a working key configured. Have a look at the following
    URL if you have no idea what this means:

        http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html

    On most Linux distribution, ncurses headers need to be installed too::

        apt-get install libncurses5-dev


INSTALLATION
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install


USAGE
    1. Create your GPG key if you don't already have one.
    2. Setup your EDITOR variable if it's not already done.
    3. Create a .mdp/config file from the example (at least gpg_key_id).
    4. Pick a password from randomly generated ones (e.g. 16 chars):

            mdp -g 16

    5. Run "mdp -e" and add a line like such:

           twitter   sponge@bob.com    yHVHPnqXyx6qUuki

    6. Now when you need your Twitter password, you can just type:
    
           mdp twitter


SETUP
    The following options are available as configuration variables in your
    ~/.mdp/config file. All paths have to be absolute, all are optional and
    have semi-sane defaults.

    # GnuPG absolute path (default: /usr/bin/gpg)
    set gpg_path "/usr/local/bin/gpg"

    # GnuPG key id (default: none, let gpg pick a key, prompts on edit)
    set gpg_key_id "6453194A"

    # Editor used in edit mode (defaults to $EDITOR or /usr/bin/vi)
    set editor "/usr/local/bin/vim"

    # Timeout in show mode in seconds (default: 10)
    set timeout 2


FAQ
    Why not 'shred' the temporary file?
        If you're afraid of getting your disk stolen, encrypt it. Shred only
        has limited use on most filesystems (due to journaling for example).

    What if I don't trust 'root'?
        You're screwed, you can't trust this machine with your valuable
        information.

    What if my server is virtualized?
        Same answer as above, but I certainly hope you can trust your hosting
        or IaaS provider.


TODO
    - '-a' will add a password, taking a number of strings in order of argv
      and using a format defined in the config file, this avoids opening the
      passwords on screen in the first place. document it.
    - more tests
    - shouldn't need gpg to use -g
    - detect if gpg is not configured
    - automatically kill the editor if it lingers. Better lose one passwords
      than leak all of them.
    - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict
      resolution (lines stored separately?)
    - configurable lock, password file, etc..
    - store/backup automatically to S3? or maybe storage works like wal logs in
      pg and the user can define put and get commands?


RELEASE
    1. Change the version in ``configure``.
    2. Make sure you comment out the debug flags in Makefile.
    3. Export all files.
    4. Rename folder to mdp-X.Y
    5. tar zcvf mdp-X.Y.tar.gz mdp-X.Y
