mdp - minimalist password safe
==============================

INTRO
    mdp is an acronym for "Mot de Passe", which means "password" in French. It
    wraps GnuPG for encryption and deals with all the small details of
    generating, managing and fetching your passwords.

    mdp is similar to a dozen other programs. What differentiate it from others
    is an overall goal for simplicity, not your average button-driven
    simplicity but more like a Unix-y less is more style. For example, beyond
    the use of GnuPG for encryption, mdp lets you use your own editor to manage
    your passwords, categorize them and delete them. I wouldn't use anything
    but my favorite editor to manage a list, would you?

    In order to avoid passwords to linger on your screen, the results from the
    queries are displayed through a custom pager that gets cleared after a
    customizable timeout (default 10 seconds).


REQUIREMENTS
    You need GnuPG and a working key configured. Have a look at the following
    URL if you have no idea what this means:

        http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html


INSTALL
    make
    sudo make install


USAGE
    1. Create your GPG key if you don't already have one.
    2. Setup your EDITOR variable if it's not already done.
    3. Run "mdp -e" and add a line like such:

           twitter   sponge@bob.com    yHVHPnqXyx6qUuki

    4. Now when you need your Twitter password, you can just type:
    
           mdp twitter


SETUP
    The following options are available as configuration variables in your
    ~/.mdp/config file. All paths have to be absolute, all are optional and
    have semi-sane defaults.

    # GnuPG absolute path (default: /usr/bin/gpg)
    set gpg_path "/usr/local/bin/gpg"

    # GnuPG key id (default: none, let gpg pick a key)
    set gpg_key_id "6453194A"

    # Editor used in edit mode (defaults to $EDITOR or /usr/bin/vi)
    set editor "/usr/local/bin/vim"

    # Timeout in show mode in seconds (default: 10)
    set timeout 2


TODO
    - more tests
    - automatically kill the editor if it lingers...
    - put search terms in an input if "too many results"
    - add password generator
    - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict
      resolution (lines stored separately?)
    - gracefully degrade when the term size if too small instead of dying.


RELEASE
    1. Make sure you comment out the debug flags in Makefile.
    2. Export all files.
    3. Rename folder to mdp-X.Y
    4. tar zcvf mdp-X.Y.tar.gz mdp-X.Y
