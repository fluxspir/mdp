NAME
     mdp - minimalist password safe

SYNOPSIS
     mdp [-Vh] [-c config] command [arguments ...]

DESCRIPTION
     mdp wraps GnuPG, your favorite editor, a password generator and a custom
     temporary full-screen pager to let you manage your password library.

     Naturally edit your password file (create, sort, delete) with your
     editor, rely on GnuPG to do the right thing for crypto and let mdp do the
     rest. In order to avoid passwords to linger on your screen, results from
     your queries are displayed through a custom pager that gets cleared after
     a customizable timeout (default 10 seconds).

     The following options are global and apply to all the subsequent
     commands:

     -c config
             Use an alternate configuration file.

     -V      Print version.

     -h      Print general usage. If you wish to get the usage for a specic
             command, you can place this flag after the command name. For
             example 'mdp edit -h'.

COMMANDS
     mdp add [-h] [-k keyid] [-p profile] [-n count] [-l length] keywords ...

           Add passwords to the end of your password file. This command is
           essentially a blend of 'generate' and 'edit' with the added advan-
           tage that it avoids copy-paste. All the arguments to this command
           will be used as prefix in your password file (with the exception of
           the options starting with '-').

           The options for the 'add' command are the same as the 'edit' and
           the 'generate' command.

     mdp edit [-h] [-k keyid]

           Edit your password file (decrypt and re-encrypt after the fact).
           This command creates a temporary file in mdp's configuration folder
           and starts your editor on it, the file is fed to GnuPG when your
           editor quits and if the file has changed in any way.

           The only option for the 'edit' command is:

           -k key_id
                   The argument is a GnuPG key id (8 alpha-numeric
                   characters), it could be used to specify your key id in
                   case you did not define it in your configuration file.

     mdp generate [-h] [-p profile] [-n count] [-l length]

           Generate password(s) according to your configuration or command-
           line arguments.  Without profile specified, this will use the top-
           level definitions for the character set, password length and count
           (see CONFIGURATION below). All the flags specified on the command-
           line will override the ones specified in the profile or top-level
           definitions. You can call this command with the 'gen' shortcut.

           The options for the generate command are:

           -p profile
                   Choose which profile to use among the ones defined in your
                   configuration file.

           -n count
                   Number of passwords to generate. This command line
                   parameter will override all other values of password_count
                   (global and profile).

           -l length
                   Length of generated passwords (in bytes). This command line
                   parameter will override all other values of password_count
                   (global and profile).

     mdp get [-hEr] keywords ...

           Return all the password entries matching the given keywords or
           regexs (if using -E). By default, this command will open a full-
           screen pager to display the result of your search, the time the
           pager remains on screen is adjustable in the configuration file.
           Note that you can hit '/' on the result screen to start another
           search.

           The options for the get command are:

           -E      Use regexes instead of plain text matches (e.g. ^.mail).

           -r      Displays the result without pager, plain terminal dump to
                   stdout. This option should be used sparingly since the
                   password will linger on screen and in your terminal
                   buffer/history.

     mdp prompt [-h]
           Enter a full-screen pager/search prompt system. This command is
           useful to avoid passing the search keywords in the command line
           (and allowing all users in the system to see what passwords you are
           requesting). Secondly, since this uses the default pager, you can
           run multiple search using the '/' key. Any other key will exit the
           pager, it will also exit after a configurable timer.

QUICK WALKTHROUGH
     1. Create your GPG key if you don't already have one.

     2. Setup your EDITOR variable if it's not already done.

     3. Create a .mdp/config file from the example (at least gpg_key_id).

     4. Pick a password from randomly generated ones, for example:

                   mdp gen

     5. Run mdp edit and add a line such as:

                   twitter sponge@bob.com yHVHPnqXyx6qUuki

     6. Now when you need your Twitter password, you can just type:

                   mdp get twitter

CONFIGURATION
     This is an alphabetically sorted summary of all the available
     configuration variables and options:

     set backup no
             Define whether we keep a backup every time we edit the password
             file. Default: yes.

     set character_count count
             Define how many characters to randomize per password. Default: 16
             or as defined in the profile.

     set character_set characters
             Define all the characters to use in your passwords. Default: all
             alphanumeric (upper and lower case) or as define in the profile.
             The following aliases are supported as shortcuts: $LOWERCASE,
             $UPPERCASE, $ALPHA, $DIGITS, $ALPHANUMERIC, $SYMBOLS, $PRINTABLE.

     set editor path
             Path to your favorite editor. You typically don't need to set
             this variable since mdp will use your default editor (as defined
             by $EDITOR). If mdp detects vim, it will attempt to add the -n
             parameter to avoid vim from creating swap files.

     set gpg_key_id key_id
             GnuPG key id (default: none). If no key is selected, mdp will
             expect you to specify it on the command-line (-k). If no key was
             specified either way, mdp will abort. That this parameter is
             ignored during the decryption phase, GnuPG picks the key based on
             the content of the password file.

     set gpg_path path
             GnuPG absolute path (default: /usr/bin/gpg)

     set gpg_timeout seconds
             Number of seconds to give GnuPG for password and pipe
             interaction. The default value is 10 seconds. This will kill
             GnuPG if forgotten at the password prompt or if it cannot
             communicate with the parent process.

     set password_count count
             Define how many password to show with using 'mdp gen'. Default: 4
             or as defined in the profile.

     set password_file filepath
             Sets the location of the password file. mdp will refuse to use a
             password file with permissions other than 0600. The default value
             for this is ~/.mdp/passwords.

     set timeout seconds
             This variable define how long the pager will display your
             passwords. The default value is 10 seconds.  mdp will use your
             default editor (as defined by $EDITOR).

     profile name
             All the variables define below a profile header will be specific
             to this profile. For now only password_count, character_count and
             character_set are valid options.

PASSWORD FILE
     Your password file should be structured to make it convenient for mdp to
     query it. Since mdp queries work similarly to grep, you want to use a
     line-based system with one line per password. The simplest line format
     is:

           nameOfServiceA   password1
           anotherService   password2

     You can separate your name/notes and your password with spaces, tabs or
     any character except new-line (\n). This format allows you to find the
     services by name, e.g.:

           mdp serviceA

     You can use any number of namespacing hints if you need more structure,
     the following allow you to fetch all your email passwords at once:

           email     serviceA       password1
           email     serviceB       password2
           irc       serviceC       password3

     You can use '#' in the beginning of a line to avoid mdp from displaying a
     password. This is particularly useful to add meta data to your password
     file or keep track of previous password without adding noise to the
     output. For example:

           # email services
           serviceA     password1
           serviceB     password2

           # irc servers
           serviceC     password3

     Empty lines are naturally ignored.

FAQ
     Why not 'shred' the temporary file?
             If you are afraid of getting your disk stolen, encrypt it. Shred
             has limited use on most journaled file-systems.

     What if I don't trust 'root'?
             You're screwed, you can't trust this machine with your valuable
             information.

     What if my server is virtualized?
             Same answer as above, if you don't trust your hosting provider or
             IaaS, good luck.

ENVIRONMENT
     EDITOR           The content of this variable will be used as default
                      editor if the configuration does not alter it.

FILES
     $HOME/.mdp/config                 Main configuration file for mdp.  You
                                       need at least your gpg_key_id in there,
                                       without it you will be required to
                                       specify it every single time.

     $HOME/.mdp/passwords              Encrypted list of passwords.

     $HOME/.mdp/passwords.bak          This file is a copy of your password
                                       file, before the last edit. You can
                                       revert to the last file by simply
                                       replacing your password file. Creation
                                       of this file can be disabled (see "set
                                       backup").

     $HOME/.mdp/lock                   This file is created while you edit
                                       your password list to avoid two copies
                                       of mdp to run at the same time for the
                                       same user.
