BUGS/IMMEDIATE
 - document the ways 'mdp add' can be used:
    - generate one at a time.
    - create a bunch of passwords and always use edit.

SHORT TERM DEV
 nothing

MEDIUM TERM DEV
 - Use the same technique as rm -P (BSD) instead of just unlink.

 - Document the security measures:
    - GnuPG for encryption
    - full screen pager with a timeout
    - enforcing permissions on password file
    - enforcing permissions on the parent directory
    - overwrite the plain file after edit with random
    - 'prompt' command to avoid passing keywords on the command line
    - 'add' command to add files without copy-paste
    - timeouts on most fork'd programs.
    - random password generator with custom profiles (mdp gen).
    - process name override (tbd)

 - Automatically kill the editor if it lingers. Better lose one passwords than
   leak all of them.

 - Store/backup automatically to S3? or maybe storage works like wal logs in pg
   and the user can define put and get commands?

 - Other types of encryption (aes-256 via openssl?)

 - Don't bother getting HOME or EDITOR unless we need them.

 - An option to default all searches to regexes.

 - Allow to enter syllable sets instead of character sets, e.g.:

     set syllable_set = ac-set-po-tru-ka-ret-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0

LONG TERM DEV (MAYBE)
 - Rewrite the process name to avoid other users to know what keywords you are
   searching for. PostgreSQL has some robust code to do that.

 - Add introns/exons style encoding to the password file to fill it with
   garbage transparently and keep the file size fixed. This would avoid a
   potential attacker from guessing if passwords were added or removed.

 - the first time you run mdp, a default configuration file is created with as
   many defaults as possible:
    * if the user has gpg installed with a valid private key, configure it with gpg
    * if the user doesn't have gpg but has openssl, use aes-256.

 - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict resolution
   (lines stored separately?).

 - If gpg times out while you're typing your password, it appears clear on
   screen, can we capture the keystrokes in a sub-process? Can we spawn a dummy
   prompt without echo after killing gpg?
