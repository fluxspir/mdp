BUGS/IMMEDIATE
 - document the new use of -g
 - document -l, -n and -p.
 - document the changelog
 - document the lack of unicode suport for now.

NEEDED FEATURES
 - Have character_set use UTF characters properly.

 - '-a' will add a password, taking a number of strings in order of argv and
   using a format defined in the config file, this avoids opening the passwords
   on screen in the first place. document it.

OTHER IDEAS
 - Automatically kill the editor if it lingers. Better lose one passwords than
   leak all of them.

 - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict resolution
   (lines stored separately?)

 - Store/backup automatically to S3? or maybe storage works like wal logs in pg
   and the user can define put and get commands?

 - Define a comment character? That would allow to skip headers and disable older
   passwords (only used when filtering).

 - Other types of encryption (aes-256 via openssl?)

 - If gpg times out while you're typing your password, it appears clear on
   screen, can we capture the keystrokes in a sub-process? Can we spawn a dummy
   prompt without echo after killing gpg?
