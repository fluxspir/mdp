Warn the user when a line reaches the maximum.

Configurable number of iterations when generating password, default number of

'-a' will add a password, taking a number of strings in order of argv and using

more tests

git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict resolution
(lines stored separately?)

configurable lock, password file, etc..
