BUGS/IMMEDIATE
 - Should not be checking for file permissions until we have defined where
   these files should be.

SHORT TERM DEV
 - '-a' will add a password, taking a number of strings in order of argv and
   using a format defined in the config file, this avoids opening the passwords
   on screen in the first place. document it.

 - specify an alternate password file (e.g. work VS home). That should be done
   by adding a passwords_filename parameter in the config file. The user can
   then specify an alternate configuration file and create an alias in its
   shell. E.g. alias workmdp='mdp -c ~/.mdp/config.work'.

MEDIUM TERM DEV
 - Use the same technique as rm -P (BSD) instead of just unlink.

 - Document the security measures.

 - Automatically kill the editor if it lingers. Better lose one passwords than
   leak all of them.

 - Store/backup automatically to S3? or maybe storage works like wal logs in pg
   and the user can define put and get commands?

 - Other types of encryption (aes-256 via openssl?)

 - Don't bother getting HOME or EDITOR unless we need them.

 - An option to default all searches to regexes.

LONG TERM DEV (MAYBE)
 - Rewrite the process name to avoid other users to know what keywords you are
   searching for. PostgreSQL has some robust code to do that.

 - Add introns/exons style encoding to the password file to fill it with
   garbage transparently and keep the file size fixed. This would avoid a
   potential attacker from guessing if passwords were added or removed.

 - the first time you run mdp, a default configuration file is created with as
   many defaults as possible:
    * if the user has gpg installed with a valid private key, configure it with gpg
    * if the user doesn't have gpg but has openssl, use aes-256.

 - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict resolution
   (lines stored separately?).

 - If gpg times out while you're typing your password, it appears clear on
   screen, can we capture the keystrokes in a sub-process? Can we spawn a dummy
   prompt without echo after killing gpg?
