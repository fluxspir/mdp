TODO/Bugs
=========

 - Check for ncursesw first, if fail, check for curses (in configure script).

 - Add -E to use regex instead of plain text match.

 - Configurable number of chars (-g without parameter).
 
 - Configurable character set used in the randomization.

 - '-a' will add a password, taking a number of strings in order of argv and
   using a format defined in the config file, this avoids opening the passwords
   on screen in the first place. document it.

 - More/better tests.

 - Automatically kill the editor if it lingers. Better lose one passwords than
   leak all of them.

 - git and/or mercurial integration with auto push/pull and conflict resolution
   (lines stored separately?)

 - Configurable lock, password file, etc..

 - Store/backup automatically to S3? or maybe storage works like wal logs in pg
   and the user can define put and get commands?

 - Don't use a buffer to read lines in the password file, assume
   lines can have any length.
