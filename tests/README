mdp testing
===========

The goal of these two custom testing frameworks is to avoid changes to mdp to
break existing functionality. We attempt to accomplish this goal by using two
separate methodology, each in its own folder.

    regress/

        The regression tests are supposed to be one step away from unit tests
        and a less high-level as functional tests. They test larger blocks of
        abstractions that are not necessarily well tested in the functional
        tests.

    functional/

        This is an attempt at some form of functional testing for mdp. These
        tests run mdp in similar ways a user would. It tests flags, return
        codes from the command, stderr, stdout, it also tests timing and
        interactions with the file system.

        The functional test suite doesn't work well (or at all) when running
        completely headless, probably due to the curses requirement. Due to
        that, it is disabled from the general 'make test' and is only
        accessible via 'make test-all'. However if you plan on porting mdp to
        any new platform, make sure to run 'make-all' for each new release.
