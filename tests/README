mdp testing
===========

The goal of these two custom testing frameworks is to avoid changes to mdp to
break existing functionality. We attempt to accomplish this goal by using two
separate methodology, each in its own folder.

    functional/

        This is an attempt at some form of functional testing for mdp. These
        tests run mdp in similar ways a user would. It tests flags, return
        codes from the command, stderr, stdout, it also test timing,
        interaction with the file system.

    regress/

	The regression tests are supposed to be one step away from unit tests
	and a less high-level as functional tests. They test larger blocks of
	abstractions that are not necessarily well tested in the functional
	tests.
